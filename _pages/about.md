I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in Control Engineering at the School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology. My research interests include control theory, intelligent systems, and industrial automation.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. HongBin Ma at Beijing Institute of Technology. Previously, I earned my Master's degree from Northeastern University in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, under the supervision of Academician Tianyou Chai.
